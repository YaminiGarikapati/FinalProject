Introduction:

There are different factors that trigger student dropout rate in Universities or in schools.Now educational institutions are in search of finding the answers what
factors trigger the most.As per the studies there are plethora of factors that can cause this situation.But manually analyzing the causes is a cumbersome task.A simple 
prediction tool for classification of dropout or consistent student helps the organization improve the dropout rates.Machine learning offers simple and user-friendly 
techniques to predict using complex dataset. Student dropout prediction is a natural problem in educational institutions and is current challenge to overcome. This 
dropout rate causes vary depending on the type of institution online or offline, student economical background, student participation in the curricular activities, 
instructor’s role etc.In this paper we are implementing 3 types of features selection methods Correlation matrix, Univariate feature selection and wrapper methods. 
These methods are implemented using scikit-learn library. After applying the feature selection methods classification of student data into drop out or consistent is 
performed using machine learning algorithms Naive Bayes and KNN(K Nearest Neighbor). To conclude the project we conducted the comparative analysis of the 3 methods. 
The data used in the project is a private dataset and the features are mainly categorized into academic and non academic parameters.Academic parameters are:SEM(1-
8)SGPA,SEM(1-8) KT,Hours on, assignment, Hours on studies, 2 hr lectures focus score and the non academic parameters are Social skills, Mode of transportation, 
Traveling time, Internet availability, Internet speed, Attendance, 5 hr practice and Teacher’s feedback. Index Terms—Feature selection, KNN(K Nearest Neighbors), 
KT(keeping terms), Semester Grade Point Average(SGPA), Correlation matrix.
